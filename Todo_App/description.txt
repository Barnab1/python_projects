Phase 1: Core Functionality (Command-Line Interface)

Planning and Structure:

# Decide on the basic actions your to-do list should support:
    -Adding a task.
    -Viewing all tasks.
    -Marking a task as completed.
    -(Optional) Deleting a task.
# Think about how you'll store the tasks:
    A list of dictionaries or a list of strings could work. Each task might have a description and a status (e.g., "completed" or "pending").
    
    
# Adding Tasks:

    - Create a function that prompts the user for a task description.
    - Store the task (and its initial "pending" status) in your data structure.
    
# Viewing Tasks:

    - Create a function that iterates through your stored tasks.
    - Display each task's description and its status.
    - Consider formatting the output for readability (e.g., numbering the tasks).
# Marking Tasks as Completed:

    - Create a function that asks the user for the task number (or description) to mark as completed.
    - Update the status of the corresponding task in your data structure.


# (Optional) Deleting Tasks:

    - Create a function that ask the user for the task number(or description) to delete.
    - Remove the corresponding task from your data structure.

# Main Program Loop:

    - Create a loop that presents the user with a menu of options (add, view, complete, delete, exit).
    - Based on the user's input, call the appropriate function.

Phase 2: File I/O (Saving and Loading)

# Saving Tasks to a File:

    - Choose a file format (e.g., CSV, JSON, or a simple text file).
    - When the user exits the program (or periodically), write the tasks from your data structure to the file.
    - 
    
# Loading Tasks from a File:

    - When the program starts, check if the file exists.
    - If it exists, read the tasks from the file and populate your data structure.

Phase 3: (Optional) Graphical User Interface (GUI) - Using Tkinter

# GUI Layout:

    - Plan the layout of your GUI.
    - Consider using labels, entry fields, buttons, and listboxes.
# GUI Functions:

    - Create functions that correspond to the GUI actions (add, view, complete, delete).
    - These functions will interact with the GUI elements and your data structure.
# GUI Event Handling:

    - Connect the GUI buttons to the appropriate functions.
    - Handle events like button clicks and window closing.
# Key Considerations:

    - Error Handling: Handle invalid user input (e.g., non-numeric input when expecting a number).
    - User Experience: Make the application user-friendly with clear prompts and informative messages.
    - Code Readability: Use meaningful variable names and comments to make your code easy to understand.
    -Remember to break down each step into smaller, manageable tasks.
